Boston Parcel Search (BPS)

What is BPS?
This project is an application that receives user input regarding the type of land or building the user wants to buy
 in Boston, and it returns relevant parcel information. The program reads 2016 parcel/assessment data from the City of
  Boston, which is stored in a CSV file. The user will be able to set parameters for their search, land-use, parcel ID,
   and address. BPS will search for parcels that match user parameters, filter Parcel objects by property value, write
    parcel information to a text file, write Parcel objects to a .dat file, and display matching parcel information to
     the console.  

How to run the program:

    * Run src/search/ParcelSearch.main()
    * Follow console commands
    
Where are the input and IO files located?:
