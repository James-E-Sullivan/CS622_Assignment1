Boston Parcel Search (BPS)

What is BPS?
This project is an application that receives user input regarding the type of land or building the user wants to buy in 
Boston, and it returns relevant parcel information. The program reads 2016 parcel/assessment data from the City of 
Boston, which is stored in a CSV file. The user will be able to set parameters for their search, land-use, parcel ID, 
and address. BPS will search for parcels that match user parameters, print parcel information to the console, and save 
parcel information to a text file. A generic ParcelComparator class will be used to output the greatest values for PID, 
Address, Property Value, Land Area, Living Area, and Bedrooms.
